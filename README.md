MERN Stack Project Inspired by Karnani Website 
This project aims to replicate the design and functionality of the Karnani website, utilizing the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js).

Current Status:

Front-end:
**Completed Home.jsx** component demonstrating design and interactive elements.(But was unable to link react with my backend due to system fail)
Backend:
**Express.js and Node.js** server structure established.
**MongoDB** integration planned (familiarity with SQL and willingness to learn quickly PostgreSQL).

Functionality Preview:

To experience the current implementation of the website design and basic interactions, visit **localhost:5000/listings** in your browser.

Future Development:

Integrate React front-end with Express.js backend.
Implement PostgreSQL database for data persistence.
